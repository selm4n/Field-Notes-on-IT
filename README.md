# Field Notes on IT

This repository is a collection of my personal IT notes.

I’ve been working with technology in different forms since 2019.
Over the years, I’ve taken notes while learning, breaking things,
fixing them again, and slowly understanding how systems actually work.

These notes are not written as tutorials.
They are written as **field notes** — observations made while learning and doing.

## What You’ll Find Here

This repository covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Networking
- Linux
- Coding fundamentals
- Docker and containerization
- Kubernetes
- Cloud platforms (AWS and others)
- Tools and practical workflows

There is no strict order.
Topics appear as they came up in real life.

Some notes go deep.
Some stay intentionally simple.
That reflects how learning actually happens.

## Why This Exists

When learning IT, many explanations feel either:
- overly simplified, or
- unnecessarily complicated

These notes aim for a middle ground.

They are written in plain language,
without trying to sound academic or impressive.

Mostly, this is the kind of explanation I wish I had
when I was first trying to make sense of things.

## A Personal Note

These notes reflect my understanding at the time they were written.

Some ideas may evolve.
Some explanations may improve.
Some assumptions may turn out to be wrong.

If you notice something incorrect,
or if you think a concept could be explained better,
feel free to reach out or open a discussion.

Learning works better when it’s collaborative.

## How to Use This Repository

- Read casually, like a notebook
- Jump between topics freely
- Use it as a reference, not a course
- Take what’s useful, ignore what isn’t

There is no “start here” and no “finish line”.

## Closing Thought

Technology makes more sense
once you stop treating it as magic
and start treating it as systems talking to each other.

That’s what these notes are about.
