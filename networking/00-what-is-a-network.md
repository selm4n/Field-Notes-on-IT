# What Is a Network?

Before getting into IP addresses or protocols,
it makes sense to pause and ask a simpler question:

What do we actually mean when we say “network”?

## A Practical Definition

A network is a setup that allows devices to exchange data.

Nothing more, nothing less.

If two devices can send information to each other
using an agreed method,
they form a network.

---

## Why Networks Exist

Computers are not very useful in isolation.

Networks exist because systems need to:
- share data
- request services
- synchronize state
- communicate efficiently

Email, cloud platforms, APIs, streaming services,
and even local file sharing
all rely on this basic idea.

## What Counts as a Networked Device?

Any system capable of sending or receiving data:
- laptops
- phones
- servers
- routers
- virtual machines
- containers
- cloud resources

Physical or virtual does not matter.
If it communicates, it participates in a network.

---

## Communication Requires Structure

For a network to work, three things are always present:

1. **Endpoints**  
   Devices that send or receive data

2. **A Medium**  
   Wired or wireless paths that carry signals

3. **Rules**  
   Agreed ways to format and interpret data

These rules are what make communication predictable.
Without them, data would be meaningless noise.

---

## Local Networks and Larger Networks

Most devices first live inside a **local network**:
a home, an office, or a data center.

The internet itself is not a single network.
It is a collection of many networks connected together.

Understanding this separation helps explain
how routing, addressing, and security work later on.

---

## Why This Matters

Nearly every topic in modern IT
eventually touches networking in some form.

Even systems that appear “local”
often depend on network assumptions underneath.

Understanding the network layer
makes higher-level systems easier to reason about.

---

## One-Line Takeaway

A network is a structured way for systems to communicate and exchange data.
